- Authour: Martin Horst

Necessary dependencies:
This repository has been tested in Jupyter Notebook4.1.1. There are a number of dependencies that are necessary for this project to be implemented.
The easiest way to test and run these scripts is through the Anaconda platform. More information about using Anaconda can be found below:

To install the dependencies necessary, run the following commands from your command prompt: 

```pip install nltk```

```pip install wikipedia```

```pip install nltk```

```pip install ipynb```

The script Classify.py represents the main functionality. It will, given a category and a search term, return the most likely title of a wikipedia page if the query is ambiguous.
